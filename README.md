# angel-godot

hello!! this is a fork of godot for use in my own games -- mostly just to change certain things as needed as well as to integrate unmerged PRs or patches that i rely on. this isn't meant to be useful to anyone except me, but it's free to look at if you want. each branch here will be a build for a different project with a list of changes on the readme here -- only one branch for now, so its not complicated
